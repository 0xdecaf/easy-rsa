STRUCTURE:
Once a new major release has started, currently 3.0, the former release will
be branched for back porting and tracking.  Currently, we have:

  release/1.x
  release/2.x
  master       <- 3.x, currently


SIGNING:
 $ gpg -a -b [file]

VERIFY SIGNATURE:
We sign easy-rsa packages with a GPG private key.  The public key is available
in the git repository (PUBLIC_KEY) as well as on various GPG/PGP public key
servers around the net.

To verify the package signature download and import our public key into GPG:
  $ gpg --import pubkey.txt
Then download and verify the signature:
  $ gpg -v --verify [file].asc
Note that the [file].asc and tarball need to be in the same directory.
